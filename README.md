LOVE-rotating-pulsing-squares
=============================

Click to create a square, watch as it rotates at pi radians per second and pulses

Uses LOVE2D (http://www.love2d.org)
Uses Lua (http://www.lua.org)

I consider this an achievement as a programmer. It took me less than 5 minutes to edit the code from my LOVE-rotating-squares repository to create this, with no errors along the way.
